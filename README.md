PowerChain 

Idea of Project :
To design a smart plug and Home automation system using IoT and use the electricity usage data in blockchain to incentivise 
the consumer on saving electricity.
Also, to make a client (decentralised web/mobile app) to manage the tokens of the consumer.


Idea of the Project:

Design a modified home automation system (IoT) that allows user to operate as well as send usage statistics of various appliances. This will allow him to manage his electricity usage.

*Technologies: XAMPP, Arduino, Python+OpenCV .

Building an API that sends the per-hour usage from the smart plug of electricity to the decentralised Application client in JSON format.
This was build from scratch during the hackathon.

Developing an algorithm for the incentivization system and integrating it with the decentralized app.
Build the actual decentralised client that uses the above API to fetch and display the wallet information and usage statistics to the user.

Technologies: Ethereum testnet (ganache cli), solidity, nodejs, mongo, Javascript 

Project was implemented in SIEMENS Make It Real Hackathon, Sept '18 at BMS College of Engineering,Banagalore.
