PowerChain 

Idea of Project :
To design a smart plug and Home automation system using IoT and use the electricity usage data in blockchain to incentivise 
the consumer on saving electricity.
Also, to make a client (decentralised web/mobile app) to manage the tokens of the consumer.


Idea of the Project:
Design a modified home automation system (IoT) that allows user to operate as well as send usage statistics of various appliances. This will allow him to manage his electricity usage. *Technologies: XAMPP, Arduino, Python+OpenCV * (We will be improving upon this (see README.md) project that we worked upon this summer.) Building an API that sends the per-hour usage from the smart plug of electricity to the decentralised Application client in JSON format.[We will be building this from scratch during the hackathon period] Developing an algorithm for the incentivization system and integrating it with the decentralized app. [see "ideas for the reward system" below] Build the actual decentralised client that uses the above API to fetch and display the wallet information and usage statistics to the user. Technologies: Ethereum testnet (ganache cli), solidity, nodejs, mongo, Javascript PROGRAMMABLE INCENTIVIZATIONS AND ECONOMIC MODEL 

Project was implemented in SIEMENS Make It Real Hackathon, Sept '18 at BMS College of Engineering,Banagalore.
